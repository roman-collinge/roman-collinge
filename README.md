## Hello There 👋

![Obi Wan](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbWp4MTRpcXZ3M3VrdDBkcHRwbzA5MGJpOG4zOHpjY2FzdHp0NTdwcCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Nx0rz3jtxtEre/giphy.gif)

🔭 My name is Roman Collinge and I am an AI Engineer and Technical Advisor at JBA Consulting. I specialise in designing, developing and deploying Generative AI solutions that produce real business value.

🌱 I’m currently undertaking the AWS Solutions Architect course, preparing for certification in the following year. I have lots of practical experience using AWS though this course will help to solidify my theory in implementing secure and scalable cloud solutions.

🤔 Where is all your work? Well, my GitHub account is evidently a little sparse at the minute! The majority of my coding in working hours is managed via Azure DevOps, so over the coming months, I intend to improve my presence across Github, LinkedIn and other relevant social media platforms. I will do so by sharing work I have completed as part of my BSc in Data Science, as well as by sharing work I'm doing in my own time.

📫 You can reach me best at romancollinge@outlook.com

♟️ Or by challenging me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org) at 'rodacoll'
